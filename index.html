    <h3><strong>About me:</strong></h3>
    <p>
    I am Theodora Dascalu, currently a test engineer at DisplayLink. I have previously worked in 2 other companies based in Romania, both my positions being in testing.
    <br />I graduated the University on Electronics and Telecomunications Engineering, and soon after started working. Due to my curious nature and eagerness to love<br />
    I decided to move abroad and experience working for a different type of company. I have been in DisplayLink for almost 2 years now and I am looking for my next challange.
    <br> I decided to learn how to create my own website because I want to think that I am more than my present self.
